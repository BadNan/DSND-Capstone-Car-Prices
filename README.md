# DSND-Capstone-Car-Prices

## Summary:
A machine learning pipeline is built that predicts the price of used cars using historical data and several features. The pipeline loads and cleans data, trains a model, tunes the model and evaluates its performance. 

## Libraries used:
pandas==2.0.0 /
numpy==1.24.2 / 
matplotlib==3.7.1 / 
seaborn==0.12.2 / 
sklearn==1.2.2
